# Testing Context: Quiet Queue
<!-- TESTING.md schema v1. Policy defaults were scaffolded by implement-tests for engineer review. -->

## Classification (policy)

Repo type: frontend + cli (Omarchy QML plugin with a stock-Perl DND helper)
Primary language(s): QML, JavaScript ES5, Perl, Bash
Applicable layers: L1, L2, L3, L4-integration, L5-security, L5-a11y, L6-smoke, L6-e2e, L6-visual, L7-UAT
Waived layers: L4-contract (no network or API), L4-migration (no schema migration), L5-perf (bounded local state), L5-chaos (single-user desktop plugin)
Compliance overlay: none

## Installed gates (observational)

L0: @intentsolutions/audit-harness 1.3.1
L1: pre-push gate lane + GitHub Actions test/gates workflows
L2: Perl syntax, ShellCheck, actionlint, vendored Omarchy gates, gitleaks, npm audit
L3: node:test + c8 coverage + Stryker mutation + CRAP + three-run race stability
L4-integration: real helper subprocess and native-DND mock fixtures
L5-security: concurrent ownership, rollback, expiry, same-UID final/temp/parent racers, symlink/FIFO/oversize/path-confinement regressions
L5-a11y: QML accessibility names/roles and bounded plain-text assertions
L6-smoke: stock Perl startup and QML-to-Model contract tests
L6-e2e: Buzz Omarchy validator, qmllint, live shell load, native DND transition, IPC open, and screenshot
L6-visual: curated 1920x1200 active-session render inspected before submission
L7-UAT: primary focus and hostile-state journeys mapped in tests/JOURNEYS.md
